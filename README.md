# Path-Finding-Algorithm
A Java program that lets you create your own maze, mark the start and end points, and watch an algorithm try and search it's way through.  This project was completed over the winter break of 2018 when I was really starting to learn more about Java and it's capabilities.

When you first launch the program you are greeted with an empty canvas:

You can drag the mouse across the squares to map out your very own maze.

When you press the search button, the algorithm will essentialy search down all the paths until it finds the end.  The blue squares are where one branch of the algorithm is currently searching for the red square.

Then it will display the quickest route that it took.
